Hi This is Chang Hyun An
And this is my first individual project.
I started coding like a month ago (written day 2016.Jan.25)
Anyways
this is called Mandal-art, a brainstorming tool, which is invented by one of the Japanese designer.

To start, fill in your main idea/goal in the middle of 3 x 3 table.
And type supporting ideas or 'to-do's in the rest of the cells.
Then fill in the details of the supporting ideas in the table that appears on every side.
